Project Title:
Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Description:
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Game built in Python language using the Tkinter library(for GUI) and Pygame library(for Sound effects).It is a simple two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" while the other uses "O". The objective is to be the first to get three of their marks in a row, which can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a player successfully aligns three of their symbols, they win the game. If all nine spaces are filled and no player has aligned three of their symbols, the game ends in a draw.

Requirements
To run this project, you need Python 3.x installed on your system.

Required Python libraries/modules:
Tkinter (pre-installed with Python)
Pygame

How to Run the Project:
Save this code in a file named `Tic_Tac_Toe_game.py` and also save the 3 sound files(in .wav format) as it is used in the code.
Open an IDE:
Inside the IDE run the saved .py code and also give path of 3 sound files to respective variables in the code before running it.
It is to be done as written below:
[
click_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("path_of_click_sound.wav")  
win_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("path_of_win_sound.wav")      
tie_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("path_of_tie_sound.wav")  
]

Interaction with the game:
Once the game window appears after running the code, you can start playing by performing the following actions:
You can click on the empty button it gets filled with either 'X' or 'O'. If you click on already filled button it shows and error message.
Once you have three successive same symbols either horizontally , vertically or diagonally you win. You can reset the game anytime in between.

Exit the Game
Click the "Quit"(Cross icon) button to close the game.

If invalid actions are done, an error message will pop up.
